# UnknownFlows.jl

We're making a game where players guess the ultimate location of trash, plastic, carbon or any ocean surface tracer transported by the ocean surface circulation.
This game uses

- [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl)
- [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) (perhaps hosting via `WGLMakie.jl`)

Todo:

* Download realistic ocean surface circulation
* Ensure Lagrangian particles work with immersed boundaries
* Create an interactive GUI
