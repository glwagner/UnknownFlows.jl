We're making a game where players guess the ultimate location of trash, plastic, carbon or any ocean surface tracer transported by the ocean surface circulation.

Todo:

* Download realistic ocean surface circulation
* Ensure Lagrangian particles work with immersed boundaries
* Create an interactive GUI
